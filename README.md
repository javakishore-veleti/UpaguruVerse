# UpaguruVerse
_A universe of AI copilots, crafted to guide, teach, and support the future of education._

## What is UpaguruVerse?

**UpaguruVerse** is an ecosystem of intelligent educational assistants — copilots that analyze, summarize, recommend, and guide educators, students, and school administrators.

Each sub-product is a modular repo under this umbrella.
